This GitHub repository contains TeleCommunication manufacturing quality control, a machine learning model for automated quality control in telecommunication device manufacturing. It analyzes production data to identify defects and inconsistencies in four key areas: production rate, EMF radiation, network latency, and speed. By automating these checks, TeleMan QC improves efficiency, maintains consistent evaluation, and enables early defect detection, reducing waste and rework time.
